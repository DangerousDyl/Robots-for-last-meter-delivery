# Robots-for-last-meter-delivery
Welcome to our open-source repository for our project that will look at whether quadrapudel robots can be a viable sustainable last mile delivery solution in urban areas.


#### Through this project we aim to: 
1. Conceptualise, design and implement a novel co-simulaiton environment to determine the optimal delivery method, considering different constraints including machine (robot payload, battery capacity), environmental (terrain configuration) and routing constraints. 
2. Develop an open-source proof of concept of a machine-robot system for last-mile logistics with a real-world implementaiton.
3. Perform sensitivity analysis of the environmental (CO2, NOx, PM2) and time-efficiency gains)

This project is part of the UCL Grand Challenges where we are employing a cross-disciplinary approach to engage with the objectives set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The goals that this proposal applies to are: 
1. Industry, Innovation and infrastructure (Goal 9)
2. Sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11)
3. Climate Action (Goal 13)
